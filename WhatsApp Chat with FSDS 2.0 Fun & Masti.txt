I was able to do using extension but that too is inconvenient

28/11/2022, 11:41 pm - .: Yea i just hate going across using mouse for something so simple 
And yeah clarity is seriously not good ,like 240-320p 🤦🏻‍♂️
Unlike previous recorded videos
28/11/2022, 11:43 pm - .: I use an extension ,that extension works as long as you don't click anything on the page ,even if you click full screen it will break extension functionality .
Only work around is to use laptop, and zoom video using inbuilt mouse🥲

29/11/2022, 12:10 am - +91 98995 21599: Basic SQL can be learned in 4-6 hours and is enough to get you practicing on the job.

Here are 5 resources to learn the basics for free:

- sqlbolt.com
- mode.com/sql-tutorial
- sqlteaching.com
- w3schools.com/sql
- selectstarsql.com

All of them get recommended highly, but I personally really like the sqlbolt one.

Happy learning folks

30/11/2022, 8:47 pm - +91 70445 10010: Use jupyter notebook and submit your ipynb files in assignments
30/11/2022, 8:49 pm - +91 80768 59069: I need some clarity on how to use jupyter notebook in neurolab… can we connect over call if you have little time?
30/11/2022, 8:49 pm - +91 72991 60308: To submit dashboard assignments, you can solve it in jupyter notebook or jupyter lab or any other ide and upload the file in GitHub repository
30/11/2022, 8:52 pm - +91 81604 16745: we have to upload all the practical at once in file or we can submit it separately?

30/11/2022, 8:54 pm - +91 72991 60308: For each assignment, you have to upload 1 file

30/11/2022, 8:55 pm - +91 72991 60308: What exactly are you trying to do?
30/11/2022, 8:56 pm - +91 72991 60308: You gave 45 as input?
30/11/2022, 8:56 pm - +91 81604 16745: In elif condition try this bracket( ) in both condition
30/11/2022, 8:57 pm - +91 81604 16745: Han ye bhi ho skta hai..if u gave 45 then u got none in output
30/11/2022, 8:58 pm - +91 81604 16745: Because ur condition is <4
30/11/2022, 8:58 pm - +91 97485 47712: jo vi input, de rah hu same whi print ho rha hai

30/11/2022, 9:01 pm - +91 97562 38399: Unclear logic

If also asking for smaller than 2

Elif also asking for bigger than 1 and smaller than 4

And what is that &? It's 'and' keyword in python
30/11/2022, 9:01 pm - +91 72991 60308: Because 45 is not within the if condition or the elif condition..so it won't print anything
30/11/2022, 9:01 pm - +91 97485 47712: study_hour = int(input())
if study_hour < 2:
    print("It takes 10 Months")

    print("It may 3 months")
else:

Only we can hope for better 
Now we have 500+ students in one batch its terrifying 😳 it self..
How they can interact individually its like impossible 
Generating many question in future session like resume building mock interviews, job garentee 
i don't think it will be done as they promised as earlier
03/12/2022, 6:13 pm - Himanshu Rami Proj Ineuron: they see only there profit they add new students in this batch also where 50% python is completed
03/12/2022, 6:13 pm - Himanshu Rami Proj Ineuron: its clearly about profit only
03/12/2022, 6:14 pm - +91 6206 587 820: Bhai don't see there profit otherwise u will go on loss

03/12/2022, 6:16 pm - +91 88254 30240: Let's complaint them about this if they don't give time concentrating for each doubt
03/12/2022, 6:17 pm - +91 80931 29545: And also the assignment are not properly defined
03/12/2022, 6:17 pm - Himanshu Rami Proj Ineuron: we have to complete 40% according their criteria

I have covered till seaborn and all my doubt have been solved by them or by you guys. 
Plus if you guys are not in fast track mode and feel like course is going slow.  you can study SQL its most important topic and is covered at the end of the course.
03/12/2022, 6:22 pm - Himanshu Rami Proj Ineuron: He is right
03/12/2022, 6:22 pm - Himanshu Rami Proj Ineuron: SQL is most important

See at least they should stop admitting more student and try to lookup at us
However let's see where we will find our self with this class in upcoming days hope for better🤞
03/12/2022, 6:51 pm - +91 88254 30240: But i joined just this month to patch up last classes itself it takes time

08/12/2022, 9:58 am - +91 99538 96343: There are people of other nationality here??

08/12/2022, 12:52 pm - +234 813 265 2712: Okay first of all, maybe the name is confusing you, I am no pastor, that’s just a nickname, also anybody can be a data scientist, what I am saying is, don’t compel the OP to dropping job opportunities restricted to India alone, there are people of other nationalities on the group.
08/12/2022, 1:09 pm - +91 99877 82439: Hi All,
I am a stock trader and coach. I have joined this program to develop my own trading algorithm. As I am not interested in any job placement, focussedon building my product, my needs are slightly different. I am still to start with any session of FSS program. I wanted to understand if iNeuron team also helps us with issues faced on the project if we are working on our own project?
08/12/2022, 1:19 pm - +91 74258 25961: Same for me , i joined for my research work
08/12/2022, 1:36 pm - +91 99877 82439: awesome.. I m also a researcher

08/12/2022, 1:42 pm - +91 74258 25961: How is the doubt clearing sessions, they address all the doubts?
08/12/2022, 1:42 pm - +91 86819 81947: Thanks Wilson. I am also studying data science as a tool. Just like studying word Excel PowerPoint
08/12/2022, 1:43 pm - +91 99877 82439: Cool. I have been quantitative researcher with passion for solving puzzles. I look at capital markets as a mother of all puzzles. In it to somve it and make serious bucks with it :). As a researcher it becomes easy to find solutions. I am planning to use FSDS to automate all execution of my strategy.
08/12/2022, 1:46 pm - +234 813 265 2712: Yeah same with me, data science is a tool which will always require domain knowledge of some sort, else one will never be able to harness its full potential.
08/12/2022, 1:47 pm - +234 813 265 2712: Sounds great, I also trade forex, although I’ve stopped for some time now.

08/12/2022, 10:57 pm - +91 86676 73716: In python, we have only input(), which accepts an only string 

But using this library we can get float, int, bool, menu like of inputs

11/12/2022, 7:53 pm - +91 70085 23938: start with 0th means K and moving towards -ve direction no character left sooo
11/12/2022, 7:53 pm - +91 79726 72276: The models remaining in my life are only ML models
11/12/2022, 7:53 pm - +91 99538 96343: because you have given 0 as index...

11/12/2022, 7:56 pm - +91 96663 38739: Yes
11/12/2022, 7:57 pm - +91 76228 89988: start from 0, and go till -10, which is not availble and jump is -1, means it should print 'k' 1st then apply jump of -1, means 0-1=-1 and -1 is 'r', that should print, like this, am i right? or wrong logic😆

What's different between🥲
13/12/2022, 1:04 am - +91 89488 12601: I don't understand
13/12/2022, 1:05 am - +91 6393 321 491: Iterator are like list, string....etc...
13/12/2022, 1:05 am - +91 6393 321 491: And with the help of generator we can create iterator
13/12/2022, 1:06 am - +91 6393 321 491: Only difference is to use yield instead of return.
13/12/2022, 1:07 am - +91 89488 12601: A = "moveahead"
print(A.___iter___())


what does it mean ?
13/12/2022, 1:14 am - +91 79726 72276: And multiple yields can be used
And generators are  fast in giving results as compared to normal functions

Difference????? Please

But execute this

Same output in first executive
Then demo1 iterating the string while demo2 giving the same output all time ...

We are having trouble with SSL when using it and have to turn off SSL verification to talk to our api's end point.

How can we give out this python client to our internal users without having then to turn off SSL?

Do you manage your company's SSL friction in the python world?

16/12/2022, 7:18 am - +91 94689 29711: Why company uses SQL and not Pandas?
16/12/2022, 7:19 am - +91 99538 96343: SQL and pandas are not the same thing
16/12/2022, 7:38 am - +91 94689 29711: I learned Pandas, now I am just finishing SQL and everything i studied in SQL till yet can be done in pandas more efficiently so y to use SQL at all?
16/12/2022, 7:41 am - +91 89513 75891: Pandas is new but companies has been using SQL from quite some time... So not always you may get to work on new development...so knowledge on prevailing technology is expected
16/12/2022, 8:11 am - +91 96064 08729: Eventhough Pandas and SQL are working on data but the purpose of Pandas and sql is completely different. If you are working with direct database like oracle, ms sql you cant use always pandas for querying your data
16/12/2022, 8:12 am - +91 96064 08729: Its depend on nature of project and environment we are using for development

16/12/2022, 7:35 pm - +880 1302-275912: I haven't been able to sign in to my account for some time now. Every time I want to sign in using Gmail, nothing happens. If I use incognito mode, when I click on "Continue with Google" it prompts for id and password and after I enter those and it verifies, then nothing again happens or it doesn't sign me in. Is anyone else facing the same problem or can anyone share me any idea on how to resolve it. I have already contacted INeuron but their solution has not worked yet. Surprisingly, though, I can login using my mobile device. To be sure that there is not any issue with my laptop, I have used different laptops and computers (a brand new one) to sign in and still facing the same problem.

As i am working in law enforcement, but I'm quite in data handling. Because I'm doing crime analytics with our data.
18/12/2022, 11:59 am - +91 83000 47139: So, for career transition after 12 yrs is not easy to think
18/12/2022, 12:00 pm - +91 83000 47139: So i looking for better platform which is easy to learn, easy to switch. That is WHICH I CAN DO. NOT WHAT OTHERS DOING
18/12/2022, 12:00 pm - +91 83000 47139: So i choose cyber security at first
18/12/2022, 12:01 pm - +91 83000 47139: When i go through the syllabus, i realised that i cannot cope up with syllabus and it's hard to learn and cannot attain confidence to shift my career
18/12/2022, 12:01 pm - +91 83000 47139: Then again i spent nearly one month time just to choose the right platform
18/12/2022, 12:01 pm - +91 83000 47139: There I came across a subject data science in facebook
18/12/2022, 12:02 pm - +91 83000 47139: Just because of the word Data in that, i get impressed and surf more on it
18/12/2022, 12:02 pm - +91 83000 47139: Then i realised that the this is the right platform for me.
18/12/2022, 12:03 pm - +91 83000 47139: Then as usual i started my learning journey at August 2021 mid. But, i can't learn myself, because I don't know what to start first and what's next
18/12/2022, 12:04 pm - +91 83000 47139: Learning is doesn't matter. But what to learn is the challenge for me.
18/12/2022, 12:04 pm - Santosh Kumar C. proj ineuron: Hi I'm santhosh kumar from Tamilnadu

My opinion is once sudhashu sir in starting stage
Many people completed this course in 2,3 months in previous batches

As per my vision if we compare to other education path like coursera, udemy, and so on, 

Ineuron is really worth, and really teaching well

Still I didn't completed my python section, but I'm feeling little bit good in python, so we can see recording videos in fast track mode. Once we complete all section it will very helpful to get a job. 

So in my vision don't think about refund, you can't see this type of course in this affordable price, just try to complete. 

If you feel bad, ask all your doubts in doubts section, and we let them know about this issue.. 

Thanks for read

18/12/2022, 12:06 pm - +91 85600 15070: ineuron selling their courses at very reasonable prices so PW launching Skill based programes for student with the help of ineuron
18/12/2022, 12:06 pm - +91 85600 15070: ineuron gets bigger platform for teaching and expanding. So, pw can launch the "College wallah" at reasonable prices.
18/12/2022, 12:06 pm - +91 85600 15070: I am also not sure but my friend is working in PW. He told me

Many of us trying to career transition, it would help us

18/12/2022, 12:07 pm - +91 6395 273 984: You know the thing is...the syllabus will be looking huge as it is 1 yr programme but then at the same time it is totally achievable in this time frame..people have completed it in shorter time span as well but it depends...

Like when you would have started law it was huge but then in this much of time you are used to it...this will be the same for this career path as well...you will get used to learning new stuff without getting overwhelmed

And the only advice by my side will be for the time being...stick to one resource...in this case i feel iNeuron is good to go
18/12/2022, 12:08 pm - +91 83000 47139: I'll discuss with you all at end.

18/12/2022, 12:25 pm - +91 83000 47139: For example
18/12/2022, 12:26 pm - +91 83000 47139: I go through the video " working with pandas and numpy"
18/12/2022, 12:26 pm - +91 83000 47139: First i complete the ineuron video
18/12/2022, 12:26 pm - +91 83000 47139: I learnt something there
18/12/2022, 12:27 pm - +91 83000 47139: Then i learn something from LinkedIn learning
18/12/2022, 12:27 pm - +91 83000 47139: Pandas and numpy courses
18/12/2022, 12:27 pm - +91 83000 47139: And finally have a good pra
18/12/2022, 12:28 pm - +91 83000 47139: Now what i gained is, i got informations from many sources and i got some confidence on practice
18/12/2022, 12:28 pm - +91 83000 47139: That's it.
18/12/2022, 12:28 pm - +91 83000 47139: Then i move next topic and repeat the same
18/12/2022, 12:29 pm - +91 83000 47139: The more interesting thing i found in ineuron syllabus is , the hand on projects with source codes
18/12/2022, 12:29 pm - +91 83000 47139: I don't want to bother about anything ... Because i have tons of sources to learn subject of my self
18/12/2022, 12:29 pm - +91 83000 47139: If i have doubts, the group is here
18/12/2022, 12:30 pm - +91 83000 47139: But, we cannot have this much of project in one place anywhere...
18/12/2022, 12:30 pm - +91 83000 47139: So, what I'm doing is, completing a ineuron video,
18/12/2022, 12:31 pm - +91 83000 47139: Search and learn from LinkedIn learning
18/12/2022, 12:31 pm - +91 83000 47139: Then do practice
18/12/2022, 12:31 pm - +91 83000 47139: While i practice, i refer websites for silly doubt
18/12/2022, 12:31 pm - +91 83000 47139: That's also good for
18/12/2022, 12:32 pm - +91 83000 47139: This kind of practice is not easy to attain at initial stage. Keeping practice makes me feel confident
18/12/2022, 12:33 pm - +91 83000 47139: Even i join in a job.. noone will be there to reach like sunny baveen Chandra sir and sudhansu sir

18/12/2022, 12:35 pm - +91 83000 47139: The steps may seems very simple and smaller but trust me

18/12/2022, 1:36 pm - +91 85600 15070: Hi guys, wanted some suggestions
18/12/2022, 1:37 pm - +91 85600 15070: Like currently iNeuron is giving 50% discount on all courses till 25th December.
Their Tech Neuron package costs 25000 but available at 12500 for 2 years and 22500 for lifetime.
18/12/2022, 1:38 pm - +91 85600 15070: All future courses will also be added to it as I talked with their sales executive
18/12/2022, 1:38 pm - +91 85600 15070: So will prices increase after the acquisition ?
18/12/2022, 1:38 pm - +91 85600 15070: And it is good to buy tech neuron package?
18/12/2022, 1:38 pm - +91 99538 96343: I think the 25000 course is pointless
18/12/2022, 1:38 pm - +91 85600 15070: It's not a course
18/12/2022, 1:39 pm - +91 85600 15070: It's a package
18/12/2022, 1:39 pm - +91 85600 15070: Under which all iNeuron courses are accessible
18/12/2022, 1:39 pm - +91 99538 96343: Ya package ....it has courses from various domains which u would not need
18/12/2022, 1:40 pm - +91 85600 15070: Main thing is will prices increase, will they give same discounts after acquisition?
18/12/2022, 1:41 pm - +91 99538 96343: lets say prices will increase...do u really need course of android programming, IoT etc.?

18/12/2022, 3:52 pm - +91 99538 96343: most probably OOPS concepts would not be used in data science
18/12/2022, 3:52 pm - +91 99538 96343: but to learn python fully they need to be taught

18/12/2022, 4:11 pm - +91 86676 73716: When a class derived from multiple class is called multiple inheritance
18/12/2022, 4:12 pm - +91 86676 73716: When a class derived another derived class is called multilevel inheritance

Eg:
Grandfather
        |
   Father
        |
     Son
18/12/2022, 4:13 pm - +91 86676 73716: For better understanding of inheritance, simply compare them with family tree structure

18/12/2022, 5:20 pm - +91 85600 15070: Or topic wise

Thank you! 
But from last some sessions one thing is beeing missed for me 
Why we use these concepts?

You see here we can handle this code without using super() it self.
If i know exact  when and why we should use this concepts it would be very helpful to avoid confusion
18/12/2022, 6:38 pm - +91 92411 15340: See exactly what i posted here
18/12/2022, 6:41 pm - +91 96560 38369: Super() is used when we want to explicitly call a method or attribute from parent class.
18/12/2022, 6:42 pm - +91 92411 15340: If there is a same name method in child  class, self will call that method not the  parent class method . So u can use super()
18/12/2022, 6:43 pm - +91 92411 15340: He may teach in overloading of methods n variables
18/12/2022, 6:43 pm - +91 94040 13696: I get it 
I'm not complaining but somehow I'm missing the main use of concept
18/12/2022, 6:43 pm - +91 94040 13696: Exactly
18/12/2022, 6:44 pm - +91 92411 15340: That wud be useful if we consider this with a use case
18/12/2022, 6:45 pm - +91 92411 15340: Maybe when we inherit from an class old class and we redefine the old method with new functionality maybe.. and still want to retain its old functionality

Employee.py and saveTofile.py
19/12/2022, 5:34 pm - +91 85600 15070: So for scraping should we learn Selenium as latest tool and not the beautiful soup ?
19/12/2022, 6:00 pm - +91 79726 72276: Yes bs4 is useless
19/12/2022, 6:02 pm - +91 85600 15070: Ok
19/12/2022, 6:09 pm - +91 6360 342 604: Bs4 can scrape only html pages not Java script pages
19/12/2022, 6:09 pm - +91 79726 72276: If you are interested in testing and all na then only learn selenium else not needed

19/12/2022, 9:16 pm - +91 73978 42050: Yes bro I am using this website it's really helpful
19/12/2022, 9:17 pm - +91 73978 42050: Can I learn SQL without  understanding python
19/12/2022, 9:18 pm - +91 90951 43179: Yes 100 percent
19/12/2022, 9:22 pm - +91 73978 42050: Ok thanks because my priority is to get a data analyst job.

Advanced Excel 
My SQL 
Power bi or tableau
 

these are enough, to get a data analyst role right guys?
19/12/2022, 9:23 pm - +91 99538 96343: what is the use of this in sql?
19/12/2022, 9:28 pm - +91 73978 42050: You can ask any query whatever you want
19/12/2022, 9:28 pm - +91 99538 96343: realted to sql or in general?
19/12/2022, 9:29 pm - +91 70085 23938: for tableau sql and tableau ,,little python
19/12/2022, 9:29 pm - +91 73978 42050: Not only SQL you can use this for any Field
19/12/2022, 9:29 pm - +91 70085 23938: but sql must in analytics
19/12/2022, 9:29 pm - +91 79726 72276: stats also they ask i guess
19/12/2022, 9:29 pm - +91 79726 72276: hypothesis testing and all
19/12/2022, 9:31 pm - +91 99538 96343: Well there is no point in asking queries from it...SQL queries are made based on database schema...u would have to provide it everything...which is not possible by typing
19/12/2022, 9:32 pm - +91 93815 76781: instead going for MY SQL go for MS-SQL Server
19/12/2022, 9:33 pm - +91 73978 42050: Bro can you tell me what is difference between them
19/12/2022, 9:34 pm - +91 93815 76781: somewhere I saw in this chat, hand written notes of Python. Can someone reshare if it is handy with you people
19/12/2022, 9:34 pm - +91 93815 76781: we have multiple databases, and MS SQL server is Microsoft's
19/12/2022, 9:35 pm - +91 93815 76781: best connectivity to reporting tools as per my opinion and am working as Data Analyst
19/12/2022, 9:35 pm - +91 93815 76781: this is just my opinion

22/12/2022, 10:10 am - +91 85600 15070: Maybe 👍🏻👍🏻
But the thing is would we get certificate from Ineuron or PW?
22/12/2022, 10:11 am - +91 86819 81947: Those who are quitting will regret later.
22/12/2022, 10:11 am - +91 85600 15070: That is not clear yet
22/12/2022, 10:11 am - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: Yeah, we don't know that but iNeuron will be recognised widely.

27/12/2022, 7:57 pm - +91 92411 15340: Let's be honest did u think they r  going to hand out jobs to 200+ odd batch in the name of Job guarantee
 No1 will it's supposed to be our hard work.. and u can't either think what they r teaching isn't already available on internet for free
27/12/2022, 7:58 pm - +91 86819 81947: I dont bother about 200 or 2000, i know if i know the skill i will get job.

27/12/2022, 8:03 pm - +91 86819 81947: I know i will get job. That's why they give job guarantee.
27/12/2022, 8:04 pm - +91 86819 81947: I know a institution in Chennai gets 2 lakhs bribe called back door process and they get job for students , if they can get it why can't we with skills ?
27/12/2022, 8:13 pm - +91 82889 76843: Elements in the set are not ordered  that's why

27/12/2022, 8:14 pm - +91 77090 76469: then 111 should come first right?
27/12/2022, 8:16 pm - +91 6303 224 898: Elements in the set arranged in unordered format
27/12/2022, 8:16 pm - +91 82889 76843: Sets are not same as list 
You store them differently and you get output different
27/12/2022, 8:17 pm - +91 82889 76843: You can't even sort them
27/12/2022, 8:17 pm - +91 77090 76469: so how it is ordered or arranged or is it ordered/arranged randomly?
27/12/2022, 8:17 pm - +91 82889 76843: Using sorted fn
27/12/2022, 8:18 pm - +91 82889 76843: It's unordered

28/12/2022, 3:16 pm - +91 82889 76843: I again say if you have your portfolio  build nicely and good profile on kaggle and good github profile  the Recuriter  himself will reach out to you.just increasing numbers on profile doesn't  work at all..
Focus on yourself than on this thing.
28/12/2022, 3:18 pm - +91 79726 72276: Thats true but still you need to build your online presence 
I am not saying just to add profiles in my network 
but having a good profile also helps you in getting referrals which is the biggest plus point
28/12/2022, 3:21 pm - +91 82889 76843: Profile  doesn't  look good by numbers but by showcasing your projects
 showing certifications competition  you participated 
People will themselves   follow you and Recuriter  will acknowledge  your profile  too..
28/12/2022, 3:23 pm - +91 92050 26533: See as per my knowledge both profile building and number of followers are important why? Because if you post some good stuff on LinkedIn and lots of people like it then it is easy to reach to any Recuitor... I have seen cases when company hired directly based on stuff posted on  LinkedIn😇👍
28/12/2022, 3:24 pm - +91 82889 76843: People with 400 connections  also gets thousands of likes and people with 1000s of connections  hardly gets max to max 50
28/12/2022, 3:25 pm - +91 82889 76843: It's totally  your work what attracts  people to hire you  not your post unless you are Content  creater
28/12/2022, 3:25 pm - +91 92050 26533: Bro that's what I am saying good stuff is important as followers🙂
28/12/2022, 3:25 pm - +91 79726 72276: Lets say 
If you keep building projects and keep applying for jobs and still get rejected in interviews 
then wouldn't you ask for referrals with ppl in same domains as of yours
28/12/2022, 3:25 pm - +91 79726 72276: at this time your Li profile will help you

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode
If you are good at coding then I'll suggest you to install this extension as well 
But if you are a beginner then dont use it at all 
(It helps in auto-completing your code as the name suggests)

सिखना बहुत कुछ हैं।।
शुरुआत बेहतर हो...
और सफ़र यादगार।।

I have an existing repository on GitHub that contains a few files (e.g. file1, file2, and file3) that were added manually at that time.
On my local machine, I have added some new files to that folder (e.g. file4 and file5).
I want to add these new files to my existing repository. Is there any way this is possible?
I am afraid of scenarios where
my similar file might collapse
or I will have to pull those files first, add the new files to them, and push them to GitHub?"
02/01/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 99819 54360: If the repo is cloned on your local and you have added the files.

You can simply commit those files and push.
02/01/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 77180 39459: Do cloaning changes URL?
02/01/2023, 9:40 pm - +91 99819 54360: No.
02/01/2023, 10:25 pm - Himanshu Rami Proj Ineuron: Cloned the git repo in local
Steps for it:
git init
git remote add origin (url of repo)
git fetch
git pull origin main

After cloned the repo:
Do create some file which you need 
git status
git add .
git commit -m (commit message whichever you want)
git push

02/01/2023, 10:28 pm - +91 77180 39459: I cloned github repo but  but it first created one folder for it and then cloned all files
is there any way to skip this unnecessary folder ?
02/01/2023, 10:29 pm - Himanshu Rami Proj Ineuron: No create folder is way to structure the code and way of using and cloning repo from git
02/01/2023, 10:31 pm - +91 81062 91087: Bro these computational errors are due to decimal to binary conversations
02/01/2023, 10:33 pm - +91 81062 91087: Before every  calculation python  converts the float values to binary values  and after calculation  again binary - decimal conversion  happens
02/01/2023, 10:34 pm - +91 81062 91087: This is the reason for the errors
02/01/2023, 10:34 pm - +91 81062 91087: *conversions
02/01/2023, 10:38 pm - +91 99819 54360: you can add .gitignore add mention that folder there..

10^10 will gives 0 because it all bits are same 
But
10^1 gives 9 how it will work
04/01/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 79726 72276: its xor operation I guess
04/01/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 86881 22385: Yss
04/01/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 86881 22385: But my doubt is 26^26 all bits are same so get 0
04/01/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 86881 22385: But 10^7 will we know
04/01/2023, 9:32 pm - +91 86881 22385: Without convert it to bits

1^1 = 0 similarly True ^ True = False 
soo
10^7 
10 = 1010
7  =  0111
res =1101
we just compare each bit which position wise 
1101 in decimal is 13

04/01/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 86881 22385: But my question is if both bits are same gives 0  10^10
04/01/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 86881 22385: But my question is 10^2 gives 8
04/01/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 86881 22385: 10^1 gives 9
04/01/2023, 9:52 pm - +91 86881 22385: But 10^5 gives 2
04/01/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 86881 22385: How it works
04/01/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 86881 22385: Without converting it
04/01/2023, 9:53 pm - +91 86881 22385: Like 10^10 is 0

04/01/2023, 9:55 pm - +91 99901 10140: Args - list 
  Karga - dict  
 As outputs
04/01/2023, 9:56 pm - +91 98893 28268: But when they are send as parameter to function
04/01/2023, 9:57 pm - +91 98893 28268: What does that mean
04/01/2023, 9:59 pm - +91 88843 31333: When u don't know the parameters you are passing
04/01/2023, 9:59 pm - +91 81062 91087: Def func(a,b,c, d=10,e=20):

Here, 
 *a,b,c* are arg's
 *d,e*  are called kargs

2. You can use a cloud vm and install db there and utilise in your project
3. You can use sqlite3 db - local db file
4. Install community Version of any db on pc and use it.

“I’m making the ultimate attempt to save my child's life.”Life is strange. It is full of surprises. Sometimes it also comes up with shocks, many of which are devastating and life threatening. Shivam's parents have faced one such shock which has turned their world upside down.My name is Kameshwar Yadav and I am commencing this fundraiser for my 10 year old son Shivam as he is suffering from Aplastic anemia which is a condition that occurs when your body stops producing enough new blood cells.This is severely affecting his health. Currently, doctors have said he needs sessions of chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant for the cure. To look at him in this condition breaks my heart. At an age when other kids play cheerfully and enjoy their childhood, my son has been struggling to survive. Please help me as this fundraiser is our only hope left.The estimated cost for his treatment is estimated to Rs 15,00,000. I have already drained whatever little savings and valuables I had for my son’s initial treatment. I am left with nothing to fund my son’s treatment and I fear that he will not recover because of my helplessness.I need your support to save my son. He’s so young and has already been put under an immense amount of pain and stress. I’m afraid his mind may not be able to cope with it all much longer.PLEASE DONATE AND SHARE!

So in your file, press ctrl+h and in the window that opens up switch on the regex usage by clicking on .* icon

18/01/2023, 10:36 pm - +91 80931 29545: It's will slow down the pc
18/01/2023, 10:36 pm - +91 80931 29545: Better take an external casing for HDD and used like pendrive
18/01/2023, 10:36 pm - +91 80931 29545: And install the SSd
18/01/2023, 10:37 pm - +91 80931 29545: U can use all the option

18/01/2023, 11:19 pm - +91 85600 15070: Doesn't slows down
U can use both together. Works perfectly fine and fast.
18/01/2023, 11:19 pm - +91 85600 15070: Use caddy to replace the optical drive and place HDD in it's place.
18/01/2023, 11:20 pm - +91 80931 29545: sometimes hardware compatibility issue is coming
18/01/2023, 11:39 pm - +91 85600 15070: That is due to caddy only nothing else. Just purchase it offline and get it done in front of ur eyes and only take home after checking it's working properly
18/01/2023, 11:39 pm - +91 85600 15070: Mine is HP and it works perfectly fine.  However I can't generalise for other models.

If you got better offer..go to that..

But try to check more about the company and also try to know what's the amount if you break the bond.if it's very low,you can shift company easily even if training is not good.

If your training is good, be with the same company for atleast 2 to 3 years..then you can plan for shift.

If you meet their expectations they will keep you or else they fire or move to lower Dept as non performer.

Due to some reasons, those plans did not work out. she is looking to shift her career into IT field most likely data science (as per my advice)  and she has been following  this course last two months and completed some basic python . Currently, she badly requires some jobs to support her family. I would greatly appreciate any opportunities for internships/jobs in this field/any that will help her to learn and to grow her career  ). I understand as a fresher and having a gap of 3 years in the job market, it would be difficult to find some opportunities and I would be grateful for any opportunity to gain experience and grow in this field. Thank you for your consideration.

22/01/2023, 9:18 pm - +91 87001 17343: in this code if you put spam= 1 you will get Hello greetings as output, "if" block can come alone but "else" can not the last "else" you wrote python is interpreting it as part of the 2nd "if" block so your code will check 1st if statement which is true hence will print hello and then goes to 2nd if statement which comes out to be false (as 1 is not equal to 2 ) therefore it goes to else block and executes it

14/02/2023, 10:40 am - +91 79834 49648: Can anyone suggest what to do ?
14/02/2023, 10:46 am - +91 80077 11992: It is because pages are loaded dynamically which means whole page data isn't loaded at once but gradually so only requests module and bs won't do the job

Try using googleapi

24/02/2023, 2:09 pm - +91 89488 12601: Hello I want to say something...

In previous lecture Krish sir told us to be active on LinkedIn it is very very important for all of us

In our LinkedIn we have many connections, but most of the  strangers are there, we don't know each other


So what I am thinking if I create a group where we will share our LinkedIn post link( *only and only)* , and all other students will like those post, it takes very less time.

Obviously the post will be related to something learning process, so there is nothing wrong to like a post.

*Motive :* if there will be atleast 25 likes on our post ,our LinkedIn will look like active.

Obviously we're not gonna post regularly, may be we will post something within a week or month

That's how we can support each other. Give your feedback

*Most important :* i know likes are nothing knowledge should be there, but it is also important to be active on professional platform, this is the main motive behind.

Protocols:
people should be active on WhatsApp doesn't matter if there is only 20 students.
They'll post over LinkedIn
There will be no chatting in group
Only for appreciation and growth 

*Write something.....🙂*

03/03/2023, 3:39 pm - +91 85600 15070: See all people don't have heart to watch these type of violent videos, so you should not share it directly like here. So you should not take it lightly. I only took action after I received several requests from other members to remove these. Even you know social media like twitter, facebook also have a sensitive and violent content policy and cover it or show warning before anyone goes to watch it. So it's about content and i think you should be mature enough to understand that.
03/03/2023, 3:40 pm - +91 85600 15070: I don't think it is any kind of teaching, it is common sense.

08/03/2023, 6:16 pm - +92 320 1241524: How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?
08/03/2023, 6:16 pm - +92 320 1241524: This is isn't taught in the class
08/03/2023, 6:16 pm - +92 320 1241524: Even the concept of global and local scope isn't taught too!
08/03/2023, 6:18 pm - +91 79726 72276: I think that was taught
08/03/2023, 6:20 pm - +92 320 1241524: Where? Can you tell me the date for the video in live class recordings
08/03/2023, 6:21 pm - +91 79726 72276: sudh has taught it I guess but I dont remember the recording number now
08/03/2023, 6:21 pm - +91 79726 72276: maybe in functions class I guess
08/03/2023, 6:21 pm - +92 320 1241524: In live class recordings right?

08/03/2023, 6:22 pm - +91 79726 72276: yes
08/03/2023, 6:22 pm - +91 79726 72276: we have to use global keyword to access it
08/03/2023, 6:23 pm - +92 320 1241524: yes I have searched about it
08/03/2023, 6:23 pm - +92 320 1241524: But they say content is mostly same. But, uptill now I have heard that previous batch recordings was good
08/03/2023, 6:23 pm - +92 320 1241524: even in the ML part where Sudhanshu sir is teaching
08/03/2023, 6:24 pm - +91 79726 72276: In my recordings krish is teaching ML
08/03/2023, 6:26 pm - +92 320 1241524: I mean in may batch

08/03/2023, 6:39 pm - +92 320 1241524: OR

09/03/2023, 10:50 am - +91 78977 68684: or any course from coursera or udemy ?
09/03/2023, 10:50 am - +91 80172 74203: Yes power bi will be sufficient...i have watched that but did not start advanced excel

Once you pay money to them ,your business is to white wash people brain and you will also ask to do same process by keep on touching with the people. In between this process they also say that our business is in more than 20+ countries you will get a chance to travel all these countries and you will be provided with nice hotels to stay

OPTION: On any Algorithm (8 votes)
OPTION: Question and option is wrong (give the breif discussion) (2 votes)

15/03/2023, 9:13 pm - Chotu Kumar C Proj Ineuron⁩: Special focus to connect dataset from database
15/03/2023, 9:17 pm - +91 79726 72276: question nahi samjha sahi se 
but gridsearch tab use karna jab strictly model accuracy high chaiye 
and randomized serach me bhi accuracy MIGHT come low 
(not that big difference but)

agar kaggle competition me assignment dena hai where even a single decimal point makes difference in ranking 
there I'll use gridsearch coz it will check for all combination

agar model optimize karna hai and u need to use less computational power then go with randomized search

killed my whole mood

19/03/2023, 12:41 am - +91 79726 72276: he is more of an entertainer than a teacher sry to say but its my pov
19/03/2023, 12:42 am - +91 79726 72276: His videos are too short, aimed at entertaining rather than actual teaching. I've seen people waste time watching youtube tutorials and then they "complete" the tutorial only to realize they themselves can't write anything and then they have to go read books or watch proper lectures or follow courses later to get a proper understanding of things.
19/03/2023, 12:43 am - +91 79726 72276: Even something as simple as a for loop, he doesn't even go into details about iterators which for loops internally uses. Infact most don't even bother mentioning iterators let alone go into details. Any good book which goes into details you'll find mentions iterators or iter when talking about for loops. Youtube is good as a reference when you want to have a quick look at syntax, understand some algorithm, quickly go over what language provides, etc.

19/03/2023, 9:19 pm - +1 (437) 986-5149: Guys explain ne one thing;
I am also onto Krish Naik's Day to Day ML Tutorials path which he uploads on YouTube. 

My question here is, I am not able to perfectly grasp every line of code which he does while creating the pipeline and  working on folders like data ingestion, utils.py, src, components etc. Is it that much necessary to go through each line of the code or its fine?
Also, while working in an industry or doing any other project, do we just copy paste all the folders and just update the file paths?
19/03/2023, 9:22 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: I also had the same problem of grasping everything and remembering all of the syntaxes, so I talked with Sunny chandra sir, he used to teach us python he's not with ineuron now but he's working as a data scientist.  He told me that just trust the process and if you don't remember anything or understand anything just google it.
19/03/2023, 9:24 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: Just keep practicing and eventually you will develop the skills where you'll know that you need to use a particular syntax somewhere and where you can find it.
19/03/2023, 9:24 pm - +1 (437) 986-5149: Sorry but this isn't a practical answer by Sunny
19/03/2023, 9:25 pm - +1 (437) 986-5149: But do you have the same syntax while creating an end to end pipeline?
So, you just create one pipeline for one project and just go on copy pasting for others?
19/03/2023, 9:25 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: Might be possible but I'm now practicing a lot and I do see lot of improvements in myself.
19/03/2023, 9:26 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: Yes ofcourse until and unless it produces the required output
19/03/2023, 9:27 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: You need to know what you need copy and paste where, to save time
19/03/2023, 9:28 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: But keep updated yourself with ML algos and read research papers
19/03/2023, 9:28 pm - +1 (437) 986-5149: Good point
19/03/2023, 9:28 pm - +1 (437) 986-5149: Reading books == Coding
19/03/2023, 9:29 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: Bse once data changes ML algo also change and our task is to keep improving accuracy of our model
19/03/2023, 9:29 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: Yep
19/03/2023, 9:29 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: Theres a website called as paper with code
19/03/2023, 9:29 pm - +1 (437) 986-5149: Also, depending on from what db we are fetching the data
19/03/2023, 9:30 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: Yeah
19/03/2023, 9:30 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: But mostly I would say the type of data
19/03/2023, 9:30 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: Bse data can be stored any where but type of data is most important
19/03/2023, 9:32 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: Like for data stored in tabular format we can use Regression or classifiers depending on whether its categorical or numerical
19/03/2023, 9:32 pm - Shubham Kolekar Proj Ineuron: I don't know much but this is what I know till know

20/03/2023, 9:56 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: Nothing concrete. Basically, depending upon what we are trying to prove... We decide null and alternate hypothesis
20/03/2023, 9:57 am - +91 6206 587 820: Bro say the actual means
20/03/2023, 9:57 am - +91 6206 587 820: Null hypothesis mean fair
20/03/2023, 9:57 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: That's what I am saying.. null hypothesis is not *fair*..
20/03/2023, 9:58 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: If we consider smoking..
20/03/2023, 9:58 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: Some say smoking causes cancer
20/03/2023, 9:58 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: Some don't agree
20/03/2023, 9:59 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: Plif problem statement is *whether smoking causes cancer or not?*
20/03/2023, 10:00 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: We can create null hypothesis like: *smoking causes cancer*
20/03/2023, 10:00 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: Alternate hypothesis can be: *smoking doesn't cause cancer*
20/03/2023, 10:01 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: So depending upon what we are trying to prove or disaprove
20/03/2023, 10:01 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: We create null and alternate hypothesis
20/03/2023, 10:01 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: Nothing is fair and not fair
20/03/2023, 10:01 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: If we have data
20/03/2023, 10:01 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: We can do all tests
20/03/2023, 10:02 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: And approve and disapprove null and hypothesis
20/03/2023, 10:02 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: Alternate
20/03/2023, 10:05 am - Sai Kumar Proj Ineuron: Even it's confusing for me ..🤣..but all I can say is.. not Null hypothesis or neither alternate hypothesis is fair or true statements

Hello everyone's i have completed one more project on Rossman sales Prediction. 

Pls go and look it in my LinkedIn and like it.. 

Why You should look after this Project:-

1) If you want to how the actually EDA looks like or want to learn EDA.
2) How to transform Data with the help of log10.
3) If you have Problem to check the Gaussian Distribution Graph with higher number so i use log10 which make it easier to looks and to understand also.
4) Robust model with 83% of accuracy in Train and Testing Data Set using Linear Regression.

28/03/2023, 7:28 pm - Karthik R iNeuron C4mL: Thats called as upper limit.
The upper limit won't be included.
28/03/2023, 7:29 pm - +91 88254 30240: yeah so it should stop within 81 right but how 90 is coming?

04/04/2023, 3:30 pm - +91 91678 49233: Dear iNeuron Team,
I am writing on behalf of FSDS 2.0 batch with a request from everyone.

Some of us have completed the DL recording classes available in the dashboard conducted by Sunny Bhaveen Chandra Sir (Ex-iNeuron). The recordings by him tries to cover aspects related to Deep Learning but many of us are not able to understand it. We understand that it takes loads of effort and resources to create such recordings but unfortunately we are unable to learn the concepts properly which would create a hurdle for us during the interview.

Therefore, we request you to provide us the access to Sudhanshu Sir's DL videos from FSDS February Batch. It would be really helpful and help us understand the concepts and topics to ace our interviews. 

Thanks & Regards

The path:
One algo video of Krish > Same algo video of Sudhanshu > Practical implementation video of Krish's > Skim the practical implementation video of Sudhanshu > Go through the book of that particular algo > Study more about Hyperparamter tuning of that algo as in interview you might be asked more about this
Repeat the same method for each and every algos. One day for one algo would be great.

usually we do imputation and encoding, scaling in the pipeline. what if we want to do column transformation like below mentioned or date formatting.  I tried incorporating it in pipeline using custom column transformer but its not accepting pandas commands (groupby). I dont know At what stage we have to use that in the modular coding. whether it is mandatory to use it in pipeline. Anyone has an idea about please let me know

delivery_person_id = df.groupby("Delivery_person_ID").agg({"Time_taken (min)": "median"})
delivery_person_id = delivery_person_id.to_dict()

In this video, we will be diving into the world of while loops in Python. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, while loops can be a useful tool in your coding toolkit. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of while loops, including how to write a basic while loop, how to use a break statement, and how to avoid infinite loops. So be sure to have your Python interpreter ready!

Finally, I want to apologize in advance for any lag in my webcam. I know it can be frustrating, but I hope the content of this video will make up for any technical difficulties. So sit back, relax, and let's master while loops in Python together!

26/04/2023, 8:56 am - +91 6206 587 820: Can this scenario happen that our testing data accuracy is 90℅  and training data accuracy is 50℅.

If yes can we say this as a underfitting. 
Or
My question is incorrect
26/04/2023, 9:05 am - Aqleem Khan Proj Ineuron: Training accuracy :- High
Test accuracy :- low

This will considered as overfitting


Trainin accuracy:- low
Test accuracy :- low

Will be considered as under-fitting
26/04/2023, 9:34 am - +91 90941 47925: we cant see scenario as you told as per my knowledge, we cant see huge differences like you told in the scenario. leave testing accuracy 90%, when considering training accuracy 50% is definitely a under-fitting problem.
26/04/2023, 9:37 am - +91 90941 47925: relate it with real world scenario without preparing for the exam well how can we get good marks in test. so the scenario you told is not possible. If some data is producing results like that i want to see

26/04/2023, 9:51 am - +91 84249 43192: Is that real... How can that even possible
26/04/2023, 10:11 am - +91 83000 47139: It may happen in classification problem, when the data not fairly splitted on train test split. 

Eg., Let's us say Target feature has 0 and 1. During train test split, if this 0 and 1 is not properly splitted in train and test variables, it may cause this error. 

You may try 'stratify=y' in train test split code. This 'y' is  dependent feature.
26/04/2023, 10:23 am - +91 90941 47925: if that is a case definitely testing accuracy will drop.
26/04/2023, 10:59 am - +91 98775 98021: Yes you can say it is an example of underfitting and can also call it a blunder

28/04/2023, 9:54 am - +91 90941 47925: Both works same, label encoding will label in ascending order. if it is a ordinal feature go for ordinal encoding. try different encoding and check with accuracy. we cant say this is best this is not. when krish sir took class on diamond price prediction he told to use ordinal encoding but i used onehot encoding it gives best result than ordinal encoding. and also it depends on algorithm
28/04/2023, 10:06 am - +91 84249 43192: Correct we should try different encoding and se which giving us... Best result

Also, nowhere anywhere it has been mentioned that we should finish 40% of the assignments within 9 months. When I asked the iNeuron support team they clearly mentioned to me that 40% of the assignments should be completed *after* the completion of the course.

Stop panicking and concentrate on learning the concept guys!

28/04/2023, 7:37 pm - +91 90941 47925: if the data is normally distributed algorithm can learn it easily. we cant convert all data  to normally distributed data. if the data distribution is lognormal if we take logarithmic of that data it will convert to normally distributed. for categorical feature its not required to be normally distributed.

11/05/2023, 11:12 am - +91 75176 43487: Hey there, I am starting to learn ML lectures today. 
Do you have any suggestions so I can learn it more effectively?

Thanks in advance 🙏...
11/05/2023, 11:13 am - +91 75176 43487: ask GPT ... it will give u answer
11/05/2023, 11:14 am - +91 75176 43487: In Python, both lists and dictionaries are implemented as dynamic arrays. However, the way they are stored in memory is slightly different.

A list in Python is essentially a contiguous block of memory that contains pointers to objects, where each object represents an element of the list. When you add an element to a list, the list will allocate additional memory to accommodate the new element. If the list grows beyond its allocated memory, it will be reallocated to a larger block of memory.

On the other hand, a dictionary in Python is implemented as a hash table. A hash table is an array that contains pointers to objects, where each object represents a key-value pair. The keys are hashed to an integer value, which is then used as an index into the array to find the corresponding value. When you add a new key-value pair to a dictionary, the hash table will allocate additional memory to accommodate the new pair. If the hash table becomes too full, it will be resized to a larger size to maintain a good balance between memory usage and search time.

In general, the way that lists and dictionaries are stored in memory is optimized for their respective use cases. Lists are optimized for accessing elements by their index, while dictionaries are optimized for accessing elements by their key.

13/05/2023, 11:22 am - +91 75176 43487: So to plot that curve ( hyperbola ) we are using slope of the line from our trials that we are doing to find best fit line?

13/05/2023, 11:26 am - +91 90941 47925: gradient descent + convergance algorithm = best fit line
13/05/2023, 11:26 am - +91 90941 47925: that curve is gradient descent
13/05/2023, 11:28 am - +91 75176 43487: I thought we randomly choose a line...
2. calculate it's MSE...( mean squared error) 
3. then we take another line... calculate MSE again... 
4. we repeat this process untill we don't get smallest MSE....


in this process we record all of the lines slope and plot Hyperbola .... and at lowest MSE we have slope = 0 

now i am feeling confused 🤯

13/05/2023, 9:23 pm - +91 80729 55326: Why we need to use, and how to use, how to implement logging codw
13/05/2023, 9:27 pm - +91 90941 47925: if you follow the lecture you can understand it, in end to end pipeline its usage is simple. if sometimes program get stuck in production we want to find it right where we encountered the issue. for that tracking purpose we are using logging. Traditional print method will not work in production. its rough idea. just watch end to end project video. its usage is simple

16/05/2023, 7:32 pm - +91 87006 43421: Yes
16/05/2023, 7:32 pm - +91 87006 43421: If we see syllabus they said in dashboard only 60% is complete.

16/05/2023, 10:18 pm - +91 6395 728 351: And what about other video like ML NLP and CV they are also insufficient for job
16/05/2023, 10:19 pm - +92 320 1241524: they also taught the code pretty well atleast in python project Sudhanshu sir explained each line of code side-by-side executing it

16/05/2023, 10:20 pm - +92 320 1241524: but as everyone said they didn't understood ML part of current course (dk the whole scenario) so as per everyone's request ML By Sudhanshu sir was also uploaded to the dashboard

25/05/2023, 7:37 pm - +91 79834 49648: Have they mentioned this?
25/05/2023, 7:38 pm - +91 81244 45107: No...but seems like this is what they expect from us
25/05/2023, 7:39 pm - +91 79834 49648: Ok
25/05/2023, 7:42 pm - Akshay Raj nikam C Proj Ineuron: What's the point of attending DSA ?
As we haven't covered the actual DSA concepts
For me DSA is a whole bouncer for now
25/05/2023, 7:42 pm - Akshay Raj nikam C Proj Ineuron: How many of you attended yesterday's lecture
25/05/2023, 7:44 pm - +91 90311 95226: That’s lecture was waste of time
25/05/2023, 7:46 pm - +91 85600 15070: Yes
25/05/2023, 7:47 pm - +91 85600 15070: Where is this condition ?
Is it introduced Now for PPT program ? Give the source link or screenshot. If so than it is not justified.
25/05/2023, 7:48 pm - +91 90311 95226: Bro check your mail
25/05/2023, 7:48 pm - +91 85600 15070: Even DSA is not covered and it will run for 25 days, so first we have to cover DSA and then attend this interview preparation practice.
25/05/2023, 7:48 pm - +91 80729 55326: Yes bro....
25/05/2023, 7:48 pm - +91 80729 55326: They said our live ppt classess right?
25/05/2023, 7:48 pm - +91 88843 31333: They are teaching in Java right
25/05/2023, 7:48 pm - +91 80729 55326: I missed the weekly classes, because of sunny Savitha.....
25/05/2023, 7:49 pm - +91 80729 55326: Yes, they teaching the concept of data structures bro
25/05/2023, 7:49 pm - +91 80729 55326: We have DSA in the ineuron dashboard
25/05/2023, 7:50 pm - +91 80729 55326: Why they teaching DSA for us, before sudhanshu said DSA not required right?
25/05/2023, 7:50 pm - +91 88843 31333: For product based company it's required
25/05/2023, 7:50 pm - +91 88843 31333: They ask in product based company
25/05/2023, 7:51 pm - +91 85600 15070: <Media omitted>
25/05/2023, 7:51 pm - +91 85600 15070: Yes just saw
25/05/2023, 7:51 pm - +91 85600 15070: But need to confirm it, whether it is mandatory for our batch or not? Because Many conditions are impossible to complete and no such thing was mentioned earlier
25/05/2023, 7:52 pm - +91 85600 15070: Need to raise this issue
25/05/2023, 7:53 pm - +91 85600 15070: Even DSA is not covered in Live classes, so how can they assume and decide conditions based on that which is not covered and will run for 25 days?
25/05/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 78744 55884: We should send email together
25/05/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 88843 31333: Yes
25/05/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 88254 30240: Yup
25/05/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 90311 95226: +1
25/05/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 78744 55884: We should send email together that for working professional it is not possible to Meet this criteria
25/05/2023, 7:54 pm - +91 97303 01970: Same thing happened with me , thts y not attending the class , samjme nahi aa raha to kya attained kare
25/05/2023, 7:55 pm - +91 78744 55884: This is how they will eliminate the people from the race to interview
25/05/2023, 7:55 pm - Akshay Raj nikam C Proj Ineuron: Yeah you are right 
First we have to cover DSA from dashboard then may be it will be easy for us to understand the practice session
25/05/2023, 7:55 pm - Akshay Raj nikam C Proj Ineuron: Yeah
25/05/2023, 7:56 pm - +91 88843 31333: Let's request for some time to complete DSA from dashboard
25/05/2023, 7:57 pm - +91 90941 47925: this ppt program should be conducted once we completed the course. this is too early for us. Assignment provided for python, stat, ml. That is taking more time to complete. Even before June 6 will take a time for me. In between i have to complete internship also. I have to follow weekend classes. I have to complete dsa first in dashboard. And then i have to attend ppt class and its assignments. so its tough for me. Anyone knows that whether they are conducting ppt program every 2 months once?
25/05/2023, 7:57 pm - Akshay Raj nikam C Proj Ineuron: So we can tell them to remove live class criteria atleast for  DSA
25/05/2023, 7:59 pm - +91 97303 01970: DSA cover karege kya ineuron for us
25/05/2023, 8:00 pm - Akshay Raj nikam C Proj Ineuron: I dont think so they will cover
25/05/2023, 8:00 pm - Akshay Raj nikam C Proj Ineuron: It's extra

25/05/2023, 8:06 pm - Akshay Raj nikam C Proj Ineuron: Bro Inko lagta hai session khatam hogaya matlab practice bhi hogayi
25/05/2023, 8:12 pm - +91 93484 83511: Point🙂🙌
25/05/2023, 8:30 pm - +91 88843 31333: Today we don't have PPT program
25/05/2023, 8:32 pm - +91 88843 31333: ??
25/05/2023, 8:43 pm - +91 6206 587 820: This are the reason i never wait for Institute for the placement so i apply for more than 70 company in there opening and simply they rejected me........

25/05/2023, 9:26 pm - +91 75430 68640: These criteria that they have mentioned are for PPT classes or for both courses?
25/05/2023, 9:27 pm - +91 78744 55884: Only for PPT
25/05/2023, 9:27 pm - +91 78744 55884: I asked to support team
25/05/2023, 9:28 pm - +91 75430 68640: Ok 👍
25/05/2023, 9:29 pm - +91 78744 55884: <Media omitted>
25/05/2023, 9:30 pm - +91 78744 55884: Still you people also confirm with support
25/05/2023, 9:31 pm - Akshay Raj nikam C Proj Ineuron: But only after completing ppt we are eligible for placement right?
25/05/2023, 9:31 pm - +91 75430 68640: No you should complete the course at least 40 percent with assignment ig🤔
25/05/2023, 9:33 pm - Akshay Raj nikam C Proj Ineuron: What if we didn't attend ppt 
Are we eligible for placement?
25/05/2023, 9:33 pm - +91 70135 62840: No
25/05/2023, 9:33 pm - +91 75430 68640: No i don't think so they would allow
25/05/2023, 9:35 pm - Akshay Raj nikam C Proj Ineuron: So how we are supposed to complete DSA directly with practice session?
25/05/2023, 9:35 pm - +91 75430 68640: They expect you to have prior knowledge
25/05/2023, 9:43 pm - +91 85600 15070: That's the real question which was needed to be asked
25/05/2023, 9:44 pm - +91 85600 15070: How can you complete 142 DSA videos and do interview practice simultaneously? Fsds 2.0 candidates can't be filtered out Based on DSA assignments and these conditions.
25/05/2023, 9:45 pm - +91 85600 15070: We should definitely be given chance to attend next PPT session and without these conditions
25/05/2023, 9:46 pm - +91 78744 55884: We must send email together
25/05/2023, 10:42 pm - +91 98603 30254: I have joined course in November 2022 and couldn't attend classes only attended sunny bhavin Chandra python videos after that I was not able to attend classes also not completed any assignment yet. Can I switch to any other new batch?. or what is the other option. Can I complete the pending part in fast pace. I am working in Oracle development currently. Need suggestions. Feeling lost here
25/05/2023, 10:43 pm - +91 82873 10942: Same here.
25/05/2023, 10:44 pm - +92 320 1241524: No,you cannot and shouldn’t be completing the remaining part in fast pace to catch up with the batch take your time (i.e. 9 months from enrollment date) after that you’re good to go as per my experience!
25/05/2023, 10:44 pm - +91 99992 42920: I joined in feb
25/05/2023, 10:45 pm - +92 320 1241524: Further you can consult with iNeuron’s support team
25/05/2023, 10:46 pm - +91 98603 30254: Pending assignment are compulsory?
25/05/2023, 10:46 pm - +92 320 1241524: Only dashboard assignments are compulsory!
25/05/2023, 10:47 pm - +92 320 1241524: Btw shifiting to a new batch has its own pros and cons so make a decision wisely!
25/05/2023, 10:47 pm - +91 98603 30254: Ok.
25/05/2023, 10:53 pm - +91 93484 83511: Before joining this course they are not telling us to learn dsa as Mandatory but now they are telling us to learn dsa compulsory...The way maam is teaching us like we know everything  before this..

Because without DSA....PPT program is worthless....so we have to cover DSA first...and now these guidelines.
26/05/2023, 12:28 am - +91 98775 98021: True
26/05/2023, 12:36 am - +91 98775 98021: Guys i read all the chats, 
If i Try to understand from ineuron side companies came to them for picking students and ineuron cant simply send 1.5k resumes to them. 
And they cant postpone the companies requirements, 
So dont send mail regarding postponing this ppt so you can practice instead mail them to make us sit in placement without dsa test as they are not going to ask this in placement so why they are putting this requirement when they themselves didnt taught it in first place.
26/05/2023, 12:38 am - +91 98775 98021: If we ask them to postpone it will be our loss only and if we ignore it again our loss, though there will always be next chance
26/05/2023, 1:20 am - +91 90311 95226: Point to be Noted. 📝
26/05/2023, 7:35 am - Shubh Vedi Proj Ineuron: True bro .. don't send them mails regarding postponed n all..
26/05/2023, 7:51 am - Jayesh Singh Proj Ineuron: Agree
26/05/2023, 8:10 am - +91 80729 55326: Bro previously also they mentioned, when you joined they mentioned in terms and conditions section.

Please read carefully.....they said for its for practice...but reality they given best questions in assignments....if you practice you only get benifits...

So try to cover all things.....


To be Frank I already did one PGP course in data science somewhere....they didn't provide atleast 20% of content compared to ineuron....

Understand how other institutions doing fraud... ineuron is the one of the best institute my personal opinion
26/05/2023, 8:19 am - +91 88843 31333: Yes content wise ineuron is best
26/05/2023, 8:20 am - +91 80729 55326: Any wise ineuron only best for data science.....other institutions taking lots of amount and they didn't provide placement
26/05/2023, 8:34 am - +91 6206 587 820: I think that PPT class for everyone so the DSA is for the Web development and JavaScript students..... 
Thats the reason i didn't waste time on that... 

If u r saying about the Placement purposes no college will able to give job 100 ℅ whereas these iNeuron is a Institute. 

So according to there fee they teach us very good and give there whole effort. 

And in IT company all want experience and with good skill. And Now a days in everywhere in India there were too many Engineers, BCA, MCA so it is like a more bit challenge for for non tech to get a job. 
And now a day IT doesn't want to take year gap students. 

So basically i want to say that: Its your life 100 ℅ your responsibility
26/05/2023, 9:49 am - +91 78795 39331: From where u did it???

This time, he caught up with a rod comprising of negative (N) and positive (P) charges. He is asked to calculate the maximum net absolute value of electrostatic field possible in the region due to the rod.

Note: Assume, Electrostatic Field = (Absolute value of Total charge)* 100

Input Specification:

input1: integer array denoting magnitude of each charge 
input2: String denoting nature of each charge, ith entry represents sign of charge at it location in, input1, input3: No. of charges it holds(length of input1)

Output Specification:

Return maximum absolute value of the electrostatic field possible in the

rod.

A

Example 1:

input1: (4.3,5)
input2: PNP
input3:3

Output: 600

05/06/2023, 6:46 pm - +91 76459 47093: This operator is called floor division( // ).

It gives highest possible integer after division means remove all number after division.

Ex - In case of complete division 

       Normal division - 10 / 2 = 5
          Floor division - 10 // 2 = 5
  
     In case of incomplete division

       Normal division - 15 / 2 = 7.5
           Floor division - 15 // 2 = 7
05/06/2023, 6:57 pm - +91 93484 83511: Okay it is not taking the decimal number after division

07/06/2023, 7:55 pm - Anil Kamat B Proj Ineuron: bro , I have another one more  suggestion , one can also  consider pursuing a *PG Diploma in Big Data Analytics* from *JNU* (jawahar lal university , delhi ) , a one year course . It's another option available for those interested in the field of data science. Last year, I applied for this program and secured the 4th position in the all India ranking. However, I was disqualified during the final document verification phase because they were requesting either a BTech or a Masters in any discipline, whereas I am just a BCA graduate.

20/06/2023, 4:58 pm - Aqleem Khan Proj Ineuron: Heyy guys

I have been working on a dataset and trained a model in jupyter notebook and got accuracy around 94%...

After doing rough work in notebook
I applied almost same sort of steps in an end to end project file on the same dataset
Like After doing ingestion, transformation n all steps
I trained same model
And  now am getting 62% accuracy

Even in vs code's notebook i did that
20/06/2023, 5:06 pm - +91 90941 47925: Okay.. did u check the random state for both train test split and algorithm? You might have miss some steps in end to end project which you did in Jupiter notebook

- 'cost' is our total ad spends for that particular date.
- 'Impressions' are the count of people who view our ad
- 'clicks' are count of clicks on our ad
-  'prospects' are count of people interested in our product (as marked by sales)
- 'Payments' are purchases made. Returns on Ad spends are calculated using Payments/Cost.
- Each row is cohortised to the date of ad spends so you can compare quality of ad spends.
 
You are requested to go through the dataset, and deliver the following:
- Create a combined report with all key metrics (esp: Spends and Returns %) in a weekly and monthly format. Decide the number of data fields you would like to showcase here.
- Which is the most profitable channel
- Which category/keyword is the most profitable
- Look for insights by analyzing data points on time series graphs
- Analyse the Impact of geography
 
Feel free to creatively bring in additional insights from the data set. Kindly attach all the data, graphs, and pivot tables in a presentation format or on Google Data Studio. Also, share your base excel file (or Google Sheet) that has been used in the analysis.

Our dear friend Dikshit Raj, a final-year B.Tech student, now, is fighting for his life after a tragic accident that left him in coma. He's been bravely battling for weeks in the ICU at IGIMS Hospital, Patna. The medical expenses have already reached Rs. 10 Lakhs, putting immense financial strain on his family, who have exhausted their savings and taken loans to cover the costs.

We cannot let Dikshit's dreams and potential fade away in the face of this adversity.

05/08/2023, 10:57 am - +91 95005 30895: The price is 300usd . Is it worth?? How good is it for Indian job market??
05/08/2023, 10:57 am - +91 79090 70871: Supreme
05/08/2023, 10:58 am - +91 76228 89988: Costly hai
05/08/2023, 11:00 am - +91 79090 70871: Are you working somewhere?

05/08/2023, 11:00 am - +91 95005 30895: No iam a student
05/08/2023, 11:00 am - +91 79090 70871: Ohh okay
05/08/2023, 11:00 am - +91 79834 49648: Tech mahindra changed their job role ?
05/08/2023, 11:00 am - +91 79834 49648: Anyone notice why this
05/08/2023, 11:00 am - +91 79834 49648: From ML they changed to pogrammeer
05/08/2023, 11:00 am - +91 79834 49648: ??
05/08/2023, 11:01 am - +91 79090 70871: Then this certificate needs some experience as well
05/08/2023, 11:01 am - +91 95005 30895: I did aws ccp and aws csa. Also I have done Microsoft azure fundamentals.  Now looking for Microsoft azure certified data scientist associate
05/08/2023, 11:01 am - +91 95005 30895: Not necessary
05/08/2023, 11:01 am - +91 95005 30895: It is only recommended to have experience
05/08/2023, 11:01 am - +91 95005 30895: It is not an eligibility
05/08/2023, 11:01 am - +91 79090 70871: Yasss
05/08/2023, 11:02 am - +91 79090 70871: Baad me kr Lena yaar abhi itni jaldi kyun
05/08/2023, 11:02 am - +91 99680 48193: Kisi ne kra kya
05/08/2023, 11:02 am - +91 99680 48193: Abhi tk apply
05/08/2023, 11:04 am - +91 95005 30895: But the prob is the course fee is  so  expensive . Adding to this training fee is also inevitable. Training fee plus exam together would cost 500usd. That's around 40k making this course so bloody expensive.
05/08/2023, 11:06 am - +91 95005 30895: There is no student discount for this course....who ever is enrolling for this have to pump 500usd.
05/08/2023, 11:07 am - +91 95005 30895: I want to know whether its worth the money....what is its demand in the job market ??
05/08/2023, 11:07 am - +91 95005 30895: Whether is it suitable for the Indian job market etc??
05/08/2023, 11:09 am - +91 95005 30895: I think people residing in the US would find it nominal as they would be earning in usd. But for indians it's multiplication. 1 dollar is around 80 rs I believe.  So it's damn expensive
05/08/2023, 11:09 am - +91 79090 70871: Certificates are just an eligibility for experienced people not for freshers,for freshers people need only project experiences.
05/08/2023, 11:10 am - +91 7397 363 330: Then which one you suggest
05/08/2023, 11:10 am - +91 95005 30895: As per bureau of labor statistics average income for people holding this certification is around 11 to 15 lpa.
05/08/2023, 11:11 am - +91 95005 30895: I would say initially do aws ccp followed by aws csa
05/08/2023, 11:11 am - +91 95005 30895: Then go for Microsoft azure fundamentals
05/08/2023, 11:11 am - +91 95005 30895: Then if u can pump 40k do this certification
05/08/2023, 11:11 am - +91 79090 70871: Yes cause companies ka criteria hota hai ki saare employees ko certified rakhe
05/08/2023, 11:12 am - +91 72763 53670: <Media omitted>
05/08/2023, 11:12 am - +91 95005 30895: For students aws gives discount...but azure doesn't especially for DP100 certification

05/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 95005 30895: As the instructions I received from the CIR(corporate and industrial releations) of my instituite, they say that your resume should be consised to 1 page. And al, important information relevant to the job role has to put in that page.
05/08/2023, 11:14 am - +91 72763 53670: noted
05/08/2023, 11:15 am - +91 95005 30895: If possible attach the github links of various projects done by u in your resume
05/08/2023, 11:15 am - +91 72763 53670: okies
05/08/2023, 11:15 am - +91 95005 30895: And if u have time create a virtual resume for about 1 min and attach its link on ur CV
05/08/2023, 11:16 am - +91 95005 30895: Virtual resume is like speaking about ur self for 1 min highlighting all the important achievements and projects u did so far relevant to the job role
05/08/2023, 11:16 am - +91 72763 53670: ok
05/08/2023, 11:17 am - +91 95005 30895: Many HR people wont have time to read ur resume line by line so they might prefer a virtual resume and judge u.....
05/08/2023, 11:19 am - +91 95005 30895: A virtual resume looks good and people would be impressed to see that.

05/08/2023, 11:23 am - +91 95005 30895: Just to quote an example.....Philips came to our institution to hire cloud data engineers. A collegeue of mine applied to that company . She was directly shortlisted for the hr round without attending the technical round. The company had bypassed the technical round for her as her resume was nearly perfect paper of what they demanded
05/08/2023, 11:24 am - +91 95005 30895: So building a strong resume and LinkedIn profile and profiles across various job portals is as important if not more important than doing any bloody course.

If u follow this, u will eventually end up in the job role u want and will have a good career growth there.

09/08/2023, 11:39 pm - +91 96994 66319: The issue isn't that we didn't secure the job; rather, the problem lies in the misalignment between our expectations and reality. Our initial purpose for enrolling in this course was to transition into the field of data, but it's evident that their priorities are different. Their primary focus appears to be on placing candidates or organizing job fairs for appearance, which is evident from the non tech companies in job fairs rather than tech companies.

27/08/2023, 5:36 pm - +91 85600 15070: Even udemy don't do like this. At least they give lectures in 500 and have rating system. But here is no rating system, whatever worse quality they teach, its directly fed and we are forced to take it.
27/08/2023, 5:36 pm - +91 73024 97878: And got bappy and Paul instead
27/08/2023, 5:37 pm - +91 85600 15070: No, i think filling their inboxes with mass mails of bad quality would be better. They need to wake. They have 10,000 of students and i don't think one mail will raise any concerns to them

The table has columns user_id, activity_date, and activity_type. The activity_type can be either 'login', 'click', or 'purchase'. Write an SQL query to find the daily engagement rate, which is the percentage of users who performed at least one activity on a given day out of the total number of distinct users on that day. Round the result to two decimal places.

Can anyone do this???????

16/09/2023, 4:57 pm - +91 89282 84627: Hello guys. I have an announcement to make. Some of you may know that I have been on a career break and doing this certification in DS for career transition. I have also been trying my hand at trading in stock market (ended up making a loss ultimately😂). My career gap has been 2 yrs and 8 months. But the main thing I would like to share with you all is I have rejoined my previous company (Capgemini). Though the role is not in data science I decided to join since the career gap was extending.
16/09/2023, 4:57 pm - +91 89282 84627: I thought I should share some of learning with you on this journey that might help someone struggling to get the job
16/09/2023, 4:58 pm - +91 79924 18854: Good decision 👍
16/09/2023, 4:59 pm - +91 89282 84627: I have not been very active on the group and not attending the course since past 3-4 months
16/09/2023, 5:00 pm - +91 87086 40243: For which domain?
16/09/2023, 5:00 pm - +91 89282 84627: but it seems currently there are not many opportunities coming for DS roles.. atleast from ineuron side
16/09/2023, 5:00 pm - +91 75176 43487: This is true
16/09/2023, 5:01 pm - +91 89282 84627: so I understand you are worried about the job and course. My advice to you is keep doing this course and learn as much as you can but try to get a job if you can first irrespective of domain.
16/09/2023, 5:02 pm - +91 89282 84627: unemployment clouds one's judgement is what I have experienced during my career gap.
16/09/2023, 5:03 pm - +91 89282 84627: if there is some source of income you can think practically
16/09/2023, 5:03 pm - +91 89282 84627: don't think that career growth will be linear
16/09/2023, 5:04 pm - +91 79924 18854: Yes but we r not getting opportunities for freshers also 😔
16/09/2023, 5:04 pm - +91 89282 84627: there will be ups and downs
16/09/2023, 5:04 pm - +91 89282 84627: I took a career break after 5 years and then the gap pf  2.8 yrs
16/09/2023, 5:05 pm - +91 89282 84627: but my previous bond with colleagues, the trust my management had in me and the hardwork I had done came to my rescue in this tough time
16/09/2023, 5:06 pm - +91 93484 83511: How do you manage carrier gap in the interview..what do you say
16/09/2023, 5:06 pm - Santosh Kumar C. proj ineuron: I quit my job in may 31st, until now I have applied 600+ data science jobs all over India through various platforms, but I got only 9 calls, in 9 calls 4 were asked me for sales job. 🥶 what can I do now? 💔
16/09/2023, 5:07 pm - +91 89282 84627: give me moment. let me type out then I will address your questions
16/09/2023, 5:08 pm - +91 93484 83511: INeuron is selling their course in the name of data science..there is nothing inside it..when u give interview the scenario will be different...
16/09/2023, 5:08 pm - +91 89282 84627: always build a good network. not just on LinkedIn for showing the numbers but the peers you work with and your leadership. don't burn the bridges when you leave the company.
16/09/2023, 5:09 pm - +91 89282 84627: www.linkedin.com/in/ajitkulkarni2805 this is my linkedin profile if you would like to connect
16/09/2023, 5:09 pm - +91 89282 84627: I will try to help you whatever way possible
16/09/2023, 5:11 pm - +91 89282 84627: yes it seems like that but as much as I can think there is hardly anything we can do about it
16/09/2023, 5:11 pm - +91 86676 73716: Bro, your previous job role and company?
16/09/2023, 5:13 pm - +91 89282 84627: for career gap people, it is a worrying scenario I can understand that. If the gap is less say 1-2 yrs you can say you are trying for a transition in data science and doing a certification and showcase your portfolio if you have build one.. GitHub, Kaggle, projects, dashboards
16/09/2023, 5:16 pm - +91 89282 84627: if the gap is more it is a bit tricky. there has to be some genuine reason for the interviewer to buy it or you should have the strong skills or portfolio to make up for the gap.
16/09/2023, 5:20 pm - +91 89282 84627: see if the resume can be improved. if the job they are offering is completely irrelevant to your profile and education then also you will struggle at the job. try to apply the job that can closely match your profile
16/09/2023, 5:21 pm - +91 89282 84627: I have worked in production support and business operations. it is the similar role I am rejoining
16/09/2023, 5:45 pm - +91 96994 66319: Hi everyone,
I'd like to share my journey in the data field. I started as a mechanical engineer working as a design engineer, but my entire design team was laid off by my company in December last year. I decided to transition into the data field and began by learning Python through Ineuron. Later, I delved into learning SQL on Udemy and YouTube, followed by gaining proficiency in Power BI within three months. I realized that to break into the data field, becoming a data analyst was a viable starting point since most companies prefer experienced individuals for data scientist roles. So, I actively sought internships for practical experience and secured one at a UK-based startup. Due to my performance during the internship, they offered me a freelancing opportunity after its completion. After applying to numerous companies for about seven months, I finally received a call from a recruitment agency via Naukri.com. Subsequently, I went through a couple of technical interview rounds and successfully landed a data analyst position last month. In my observation of the market during this time, I noticed that securing a data scientist role, especially as a fresher, is quite challenging. Companies often have a surplus of developers but only hire a few data scientists. In the early stages, startups primarily require data engineers to handle and store their data and data analysts to analyze it. Despite being a highly lucrative job, there's an imbalance in opportunities for aspirants. There's a plethora of master's programs and courses focused on data science, but very few emphasize the importance of honing skills in data engineering. However, it's crucial to recognize that without proficient data engineers to gather and store data, data scientists can't effectively perform their roles. Therefore, I suggest aspiring individuals to diversify their skills for an entry into the data field. Once you've entered, there's ample opportunity to advance and become a data scientist in the future. The primary goal should be to secure a foothold in the data field. These insights are purely based on my personal experience and opinions, and I hope this analysis proves beneficial to prospective aspirants looking to navigate the market.
